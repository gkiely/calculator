TODO:
App

- Move the if conditions to the route, why do we even need a machine?


- Add machine logic to route
  - In route, replace if logic with the machine logic to determine state
  I think will still need if logic for determining the input/result output
  But it should still be much cleaner than this current setup


- Replace string math with doMath


Done
- Update routing to terminal app routing approach x
  - Call route get directly from button with button text that was clicked instead of history
