TODO:
- Get new structure working
  - Test with fetch

- I need to get this working at the react-router level, so teams can gradually
adopt it, including our team

- /component route
- visual debugger
  - I think this, combined with no react-router, hooks or redux might tip it over the edge

  - Build an example for cr-smart-tv-components

V2
- Being able to then recreate user state would be pretty awesome
- Read through the Elm docs
- Make any adjustments
- Write documentation
- Reach out to a few more people and get feedback
- Launch on HN

V3
- Allow /component for normal react apps using react-router
  - Either via the jest tests or a props editor
- Get machine example working

- sub realms
- Naming
  - Realm
    - createRealm
    - createRoute: While this makes sense, it is possible to use it not for a route, you could use it for a sub route
  - sru
  - mvu

- For elm folks, support the aliases model, view, update
  - Write types to ensure there are not duplicates

- Fetching and then navigating, should cancel all requests
  - Implement x
  - Test
- Make fetch/requests more intuitive
- Do we still need onLeave for second.tsx?

- Experiment (3 functions)
  - update: Change it to be a reducer
  - session
  - view
    - state, session, 
https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
  - Add typings to prevent functions being added

- Exercise
  - 2 results that can each be activated from a button
    - I would have an array to store in session (or state)
    - When toggling, it changes which array to update

- Build a counter
- Build cr-smart-tv as an example
- Docs
- Ship

- No re-render if state is the same (or route returned is undefined?)
- Instead of Location<'Button'> for a container it should be Location<'/'>
  - Containers should be written for routes, but no updates to components are needed
- Clean up types
- All params are currently required to be optional
  - See if it's because return type is using union

Then
- Try building a navigational app ala. smart-tv
// Write different containers for the same component that can be used by the server
const containers = {
  default: (props) => {
    const useDispatch = useAppDispatch();
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <Card {...props} onClick={() => 'do this thing'} />
      </div>
    );
  },
  video: (props) => (
    <div className="container-video">
      <Card {...props} onClick={() => 'do this thing'} />
    </div>
  ),
}
