TODO:
- Setup an event listener like in `shell` so you can call updates from the server
- Write a comment or add to readme why we're using the state object
  - It allows triggering re-renders without doing recursion (each update is rendered)
  - It allows maintaining state without storing a key: value cache for every user
  - It allows calling update from any component without the entire state
  - It's pure
  - It isn't used in the app, except for re-rendering
  - It basically avoids me having to pass props to every component to then pass to update
    - Each component has access to state when calling update, but otherwise it has no access

- Rename from routeParams -> routeState
- Remove sectionCount in utils/index.tsx
- Clean up types

- All params are required to be optional
  - See if it's because return type is using union

- Eslint plugin error
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Update to newest CRA
- Add history
  - Either using to, or an event listener
- Replace string math with your own math function
- Fix input styling
- Fix createRoute using an increment id
- Automate component/index.tsx creation
