TODO:
App
- Update routing to terminal app routing approach
  - Call route get directly from button with button text that was clicked instead of history

Button
- Add machine logic to route
  - In route, replace if logic with the machine logic to determine state
  I think will still need if logic for determining the input/result output
  But it should still be much cleaner than this current setup
