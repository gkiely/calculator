TODO:
- Exercise
  - 2 results that can each be activated from a button
    - I would have an array to store in session (or state)
    - When toggling, it changes which array to update
- Fetching and then navigating, should cancel all requests

- No re-render if state is the same (or route returned is undefined?)
- Instead of Location<'Button'> for a container it should be Location<'/'>
  - Containers should be written for routes, but no updates to components are needed
- Clean up types
- All params are currently required to be optional
  - See if it's because return type is using union

Then
- Try building a navigational app ala. smart-tv
// Write different containers for the same component that can be used by the server
const containers = {
  default: (props) => {
    const useDispatch = useAppDispatch();
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <Card {...props} onClick={() => 'do this thing'} />
      </div>
    );
  },
  video: (props) => (
    <div className="container-video">
      <Card {...props} onClick={() => 'do this thing'} />
    </div>
  ),
}
