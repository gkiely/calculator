 * For complex screens, you create sub routes

 * - They can also be provided specific parts of the route state if needed so they can only modify certain parts

/**
 * You can think of a Realm as a container for your UI's business logic, state and side effects.
 * A Realm accepts actions, processes state, performs side effects and returns a JSON representation of your UI.
 *
 * Basic premise
 * - If you move all your UI conditionals, state, side effects (and eve routing) out side of your view, you're left with simple stateless components
 * This makes your UI more reusable, easier to maintain, scalable and easier to test
 *
 *
 * A unidirectional state management library for react, based on the mvu pattern (model-view-update)
 * - By moving UI conditionals, state, effects (and even routing) outside of your view, you make your UI more reusable and scalable.
 *
 * Decouple your UI and business logic from your application
 *
 *
 * Current approach is UI drives the state
 * - Some condition is met in the UI (event handler or state)
 * - Perform state update or side effect
 * - UI is updated to reflect new state
 *
 * New approach - State drives the UI
 * - All interactions are fed to Realm
 * - Realm processes state and updates UI

/**
 * Problem:
 * - Managing react state and effects can be cumbersome and non-intuitive
 *
 * Solution:
 * An elm inspired state management library for React
 *
 * Route
 * - state - the state of your application, the only thing that can mutate
 * - render - a way to turn your state into UI (json)
 * - update - a way to update your state based current state and actions
 * * effects - a way to update your state based on external events
 * * onLeave - a way to update your state when leaving a route
 *
 * * effects and onLeave are optional
 *
 * interaction -> update -> render
 *
 * It recommended to structure your application into 2 parts:
 * - Components: dumb, re-usable components
 * - Routes: business logic and UI structure
 *
 * Route rules:
 * 3 properties (state, view, reducer) + 2 optional (effects, onLeave)
 * - Optionally use `machine` instead of reducer, state and effects
 * - when machine is used, view gets called with 2 parameters (state, current)
 *
 * Render function is pure, it accepts a state object and returns json
 * should be able to run in a service worker or a node instance (for SSR and portability)
 *
 * Any changes to state in the update or the effects function update the UI automatically
 * Uses server-sent events api for pushing async updates to client
 * Automatically cancels previous view's async requests
 * You can use immer or redux
 * TODO: support state machines instead of redux
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/54521035/1845423
 *
 * State persists between routes unless specifically removed on leave
 *
 *
 * FAQ:
 * Why should I use this?
 * - It simplifies your project structure
 *    - It makes it so there are 2 places a developer can update your application:
 *    - Components
 *    - Routes: Business logic and component structure
 * - It requires no use of hooks or a  state management library, just a single call to `update` from every component
 * - It encourages building components that are re-usable
 * - The encourages writing business logic that is re-usable
 * - It separates business logic from your UI
 * - It allows generating new screens without touching your components
 *
 * Why return JSON from the view instead of html or jsx?
 * 1. JSON is platform and library agnostic
 *    - It is possible to generate views from JSON using javascript, swift, kotlin
 *    - It is possible to generate views using react, vue, etc.
 *      - The ability to use libraries is a big advantage as it allows for use of the library's components, api and tooling.
 *      - It's possible to generate html with React or Vue for example using server-side rendering
 * 2. Using JSON separates business logic from UI implementation details
 *    - Rendering html is an implementation detail, just as rendering a SPA application on the client is a UI implementation detail
 *      - The user does not care if you use server rendered HTML, React, Vue or any other library.
 *      - Using JSON allows for UI implentation flexibility. Either server render or use a library, it is up to you.
 *
 *
 * Realm replaces: Redux, React-router, useEffect, useState and useReducer.
 * Additional notes:
 * - Replaces redux, hooks, react-router
 *
 * - At the top level you define a:
 * <Realm routes={routes} />
 */

/**
 * Personal notes
 * Who is my target audience?
 * - Anyone who is fed up with the current state management system of react or organization of components
 * - Anyone who was an elm developer
 *
 *
 * I'm gonna have a crack at an elm style react state mgmt library. No react-router, redux or hooks needed. Just a single object with the properties (state, render, update, effects). Outputs json and maps to components.

Manual Abort example
   // if (!payload || typeof payload !== 'string') return;
  // const allowedActions = ['fetch'];

  // if (typeof type === 'string' && !allowedActions.includes(type)) return;

  // if (type === 'fetch') {
  //   if (requests.button) {
  //     requests.button.abort();
  //   }

  //   const controller = new AbortController();
  //   requests.button = controller;
  //   const getData = async () => {
  //     try {
  //       const data = await (await fetch(payload, controller)).json();
  //       requests.button = null;

  //       /// TODO this should be called automatically by the library?
  //       // after a state change
  //       // batch state changes into a single animation frame then call it
  //       emitter.emit('update', {
  //         buttonText: data.id,
